# Advent of Code - Day 7 - 2019: Amplification Circuit

This is my [Advent of Code day 7 solution](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/7).

Code here: [/lib/](/lib/)

Tests here: [/test/](/test/)

I broke the computer up with a program token that it uses to keep track of things. I also stuck with using structs for the thruster and amplifier as it reads well with the problem.

Would love any feedback!

## Tests

```
mix test
```
